OSXMemory
=========

This is an ongoing attempt to create a easy-to-script memory editor in Ruby.

The hooking methods are influenced by (and, in some places, pulled from) https://github.com/tduehr/ragweed.

This project focuses purely on making it easier to create APIs for OSX (64-bit) based applications with Ruby.

Everything in this project requires sudo privileges to run.
